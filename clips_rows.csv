Once cured, remove from the fridge and admire these gorgeous golden pearls. The yolks have firmed up to a spreadable, almost jam-like consistency. Place the spicy yolks on some crispy bread, smash them down and why not finish with a little extra hot honey and a touch of sea salt for good measure.

With the help of frozen Costco sea bass, I‚Äôve unlocked a perfect meal that scores HIGH on price, convenience, and flavor. It costs less than $2.50 per serving, can be prepared from frozen, and you don‚Äôt need to visit a fish monger. It‚Äôs a version of the popular Chinese steamed sea bass that we all loved as a kid (except me), and it can be made in 20 minutes flat. 15 minutes if you already have the ginger and scallion prepared.

I was honestly surprised to learn that most of us loved this dish as a kid, because I absolutely HATED it. There was a period of time my mom made this for dinner almost every night and choking on fish bones was my worst nightmare üòÖ¬†But as an adult, I‚Äôve finally grown to love this dish because of how simple, light, yet incredibly delicious it is - it‚Äôs one of my favorite things to order at a Chinese restaurant.

Ingredients:

- Costco frozen sea bass filet
- 2 inch ginger (julienned)
- 1 - 2 green onions (julienned)
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil (or another neutral oil)
- 1.5 tbsp soy sauce

Instructions

- Julienne the ginger and green onions. Make sure to separate the green and white parts
- Place the frozen filet in a steamer
- Place ginger and green onion whites on top of fish
- Steam for 12 minutes over simmering water (medium high heat)
- Heat up vegetable oil to 350F degrees (or when the oil begins shimmering / shows slight wisp of smoke)
- Place the remaining scallion greens on top of the steamed fish
- Drizzle hot oil onto fish
- Add soy sauce on top

Enjoy!

Costco sells frozen sea bass, which works great for making this popular Chinese steamed fish in 20 minutes flat. I count it. It's cheap, it's delicious, and it's convenient because you can steam it straight from frozen. And the best part is you won't choke on a fish bone because there are none. For my fellow Chinese Americans, you either loved this dish or hated it as a kid. Seems like most of us loved it, which I didn't anticipate. But I hated it because if you weren't careful, you got stabbed in the throat with a prickly fish bone. And we've all been there, careful or not. But my mom kept saying eating fish will make you smarter. But I refused because who cares about having 200 IQ if I die choking on a fish? But now I'm older, and you know what? I've genuinely grown to appreciate this dish, and it is now one of my favorites. So thank you, mom, for never giving up on me.

So the start of the walk is pretty flat until you hit Gribgoch, and when you do, you'll know straight away as you'll encounter this steep section. I recommend going as low and slow as possible. Carry on until you hit the ridge. Now the ridge is absolutely breathtaking. It's about twice as long as Striding Edge and it's so dramatic. But you do need to do a little bit of rock climbing to get through this section. You'll carry on and you'll hit a second ridge, which again is just as dramatic as the first, and then you hit the summit. Once you've finished taking in the stunning North Wale views, you're going to want to head down. Now I recommend heading down via the Miner's Path or the Pig Path. It's a little bit safer and a little bit quicker. And as you can see, you can take in some stunning views of the tarns in the area. And I also recommend finishing the night off with a camp if you can. Some of my favourite camping locations are located in Anglesey and North Wales. And as always, thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one.

Here is the simplest Hainanese chicken recipe you can make that doesn't require you to boil and poach a whole chicken. And you can make all of this in your rice cooker. For the chicken, we're using chicken thighs with skin on. I used to make this the 100% way. In fact, Hainanese chicken was one of the first real recipes I attempted when I started learning how to cook back in college. Each week, my roommates and I would pick a new dish that we'd try to master. And one week, it was Hainanese chicken. So what we would do is, we'd buy all of its ingredients in bulk, and make that dish non-stop for an entire week until we felt like we nailed it, or ran out of ingredients. There were weeks where we had Hainanese chicken for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So yeah, while the 100% way is delicious, I wish we knew about this 80-20 version back in university, because it's so much easier, and I think it gets you more than close enough. Especially if you make the iconic ginger scallion and chili sauce to go with it. Which, in my opinion, is what really completes this dish.

On day 0, you're going to arrive at the airport, pick up your rental car, and hit the Blue Lagoon. Trust me, relaxing here is the perfect way to end a travel day. The next morning, you'll start your first official day at Sellylandsfoss. Be sure to check out the secret canyon waterfall right next door. And then it's off to Sk√≥gafoss where you also want to hike back into the highlands for even more waterfalls. You'll start day 2 with a drive down to the Black Sand Beach and check out the nearby sea cliffs and lighthouse before continuing your drive onto the canyon that no one can pronounce. Day 3 starts off with one of the most unique experiences we've ever done, hiking on a glacier in Vatnaj√∂kull National Park. After the hike, you'll end the day at Diamond Beach and the Glacier Lagoon. Day 4 kicks off with a scenic drive along the eastern coast of the island and be sure to keep your eye out for reindeer here. Then relax and shower at Vokbas before ending the day at Sulegill Canyon. On day 5, you'll take a walk around the Mifton Geothermal Area and check out G√∂tafoss on your way to Akureyri to grab some food. Day 6 is all about exploring the Snaefellnes Peninsula with stops at Kirksj√∂fell and the Arnostapi coastal cliffs. The final day starts off at Reykjavik's Sky Lagoon and ends by exploring and walking the streets of the city.

@soupcomcr has recently opened its doors just off Piccadilly Gardens, serving up huge noodle hot pots that you create yourself, just like a pick n‚Äô mix.

The concept is dead simple. Grab a bowl, fill it with as many ingredients as you like, and then choose your broth to go with it.

There are loads of options, ranging from the expected to the unexpected ‚Äì so there are prawns, pak choi, quail eggs, Japanese sausage and meatballs, right up to jellyfish, duck blood, crab nuggets, purple sweet potato noodles, and even frogs legs (and that‚Äôs barely scratching the surface).

Then you pick your broth, so you‚Äôve got the signature spicy malatang, tom yum, mushroom, and a peanut dry mix.

It‚Äôs ¬£2.99 for every 100g of ingredients, and the broth is ¬£3.50, so add as much or as little as you like, then get properly stuck in.

It‚Äôs great fun, and delicious. Win win.

So after you've chose your ingredients, you've got to choose your soup. I'm gonna go for the spicy one. This is a little condiment section. Walk along, put some sauce in there, mix it up, dip your meat in there, or you can just add it to your broth.

We have been car camping for years now out of the back of multiple SUVs, and it‚Äôs always going to be one of our favorite ways to travel. It‚Äôs budget friendly, simple, and can be really comfortable with a good setup!

Here are some things that have really improved our experience: 

‚Ä¢ @segwaypowerstationofficial Cube Series Power Station: this power station has been so nice to have on our trips to charge all of our electronics, power lights, and fan, our air pump, and it can even power our outdoor camping grill. 

We charge it while we‚Äôre driving (it charges fully in 1.6 hours), it‚Äôs waterproof, durable, and we can add or remove battery packs depending on how long our trip is! The battery can function as normal from 14 degrees to 113 degrees, so we don‚Äôt have to worry about extreme temperatures affecting output. 

You can get $200 off using the code CUBE2000 at the link in our bio!

‚Ä¢ car air mattress: we used our backpacking sleeping pads for years, which is fine, but having an actual mattress that fits the car perfectly really takes advantage of all of the room available

‚Ä¢ cushions for under the heads: you lose a lot of space up past the front of the seats, so these allow us a few more inches without our heads hanging lower than the rest of us

‚Ä¢ bug nets and a tiny fan: these really help to keep it cool inside on summer trips without letting bugs in 

Do you camp in the back of your car? What‚Äôs your favorite thing about your setup?

We have camped in the back of our SUV for years, and this is what our setup looks like for two people. When we get to camp, the cooler and camp kitchen comes out and any soft hair gets put in the passenger seat. And the whole bed literally just unrolls and inflates. You will not catch me using a sleeping bag if it's any warmer than 50 degrees. We have piles of blankets and pillows instead. And these cushions under the heads give us a few extra inches of space to sleep so we don't feel cramped. We keep the Segway Portable Power Station Cube 2000 behind the driver's seat, and this gives us plenty of power to use our air pump, charge phones and laptops, run lights and honestly never worry about running out. We typically charge it while we're driving. And what I think is really cool is that we can add or remove battery packs depending on how long our trip is and how much power we need. We put bug nets over the window so we can roll them down and get some fresh air inside. And you would not believe how much this little tiny fan does for two people. One day we may choose to build something. But for now, we are very happy with how budget friendly and easy this setup is.

Join me on my hunt to find the best roast in London, where this week, we're at the Temal Crown, a new desi pub in North London, sister restaurant to the Temal Prince. We're kicking things off with the onion bhajis, which are handmade to order. And to this day, they are the best onion bhaji I've ever put in my mouth. Outrageous. This is the masala lamb shank roast, which is cooked for six hours and then finished off on the grill. And they serve it with a gravy from all that leftover stock. These platters are incredible. They come with potatoes, veg, poppadoms, obviously the lamb shank, which just falls off the bone. There is such a depth in flavour. It will literally send your taste buds into next week. Prince has also brought over his famous rotis too, which he spins around his head like a lasso. The rotis here are just incredible. They're soft, they're crispy, they're buttery. Just listen to this. Just look how flaky they are. But the best part is building your roti with the lamb, with the crispy cauliflower, the cabbage, and then dunking it in that gravy. All aboard the gravy chain, choo-choo. The barbecue masala roasted chicken was another favourite too. You get these big legs of chicken, which have been marinated for days. Just look at the colour and crispiness of that skin. Gotta finish it off in a crispy poppadom. If you can't take a date, mate, enjoy.

There are a lot of mountain huts or refuges along the way so you can leave your tent and sleeping bag at home. They also provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so no need to worry about food either. The price can range anywhere from $50 to $100 per night, including food. The only problem with refuges is that depending on the season, you might need to start booking a few months in advance to secure a spot.

üìçLove Lake, Vancouver Island, Canada

Directions

This Lake can be accessed by either taking a 45 minute boat or kayaking 22km to the trailhead. From there you hike 16km to camp and then the next day you hike up 600m to Love Lake. You want to do this for 2 nights so that you can have a lake day on the 2nd day and hike back out on the 3rd day. 

This is one of the most remote and pristine lakes in Canada and is seriously worth the hike!

This hike also brings you to Della Falls, the tallest waterfall in Canada!! üá®üá¶",megmitchell123,1394175,50970,340282366841710301244259553717670607228,"Promise that you'll hold me close, don't let me go Take my heart, don't break it Love me, meet me

Their menu is pretty big but I highly recommend trying the Scallops, Fried Squid, Salt & Pepper Prawns, Deep Fried Chicken and Black Bean Clams üî• It‚Äôs best to go with at least 5-6 people so you can try more and spend less PP (the portion are also big üëÄ)

üìçSan Hing St, Cheung Chau

We had the best seafood experience and it did not break the bank. Guys, this place has a fixed price based on the amount of dishes you order. So we only spent $165 each on 7 dishes, which includes drinks. That's insane. Of course, we ordered all the good stuff. Scallop, fried squid, and prawns. I love that they overloaded with garlic and you can literally eat the shell on these prawns. Oh, and this chicken definitely had some crazy MSG seasoning. Of course, we also tried the famous mango mochi and slushy. Oh my god, you have to come to Cheung Chau to eat this. We also saw this little kid eat this frozen watermelon slice. And of course, we had to track this down. And it was so worth it. Follow me for more hidden gems and hot spots.
